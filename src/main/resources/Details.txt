Achieved:
    Method level Undo working
    All data is cleared when file is closed

Limitations:
    Only for Java
    Only for Methods
    Occupies large memory
        Storing whole method body per change
    Character wise Undo
    Can't detect parameter, return type, method name changes
    No cleanup method

Implementation challanges:
    Implemented Listener, Action, Service
    Keyboard shortcut + Menu option
    Using own stack, not inbuilt
    Before, replacing whole method made new method stack, solved by just changing body.
    Made Listener stop listening changes when I("plugin code") updates the method, solved by using flag.
    Before, without any changes if we press undo, clash with flag and resulted in lost of the first change.
