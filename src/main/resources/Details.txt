Achieved:
    Method level Undo working
    All data is cleared when file is closed
    Provides option to clear all data in Edit Menu
    Only storing changes instead of whole method
    Can detect parameter, return type, method name changes
    Setting caret position at the end of the change
    Menu available only when change is present
    Redo functionality

Limitations:
    Only for Java
    Only for Methods
    Character wise Undo

Upcoming Features:
    Auto delete earlier data if memory is less
    Buffered undo changes instead of character wise

Implementation challanges:
    Implemented Listener, Action, Service
    Keyboard shortcut + Menu option
    Using own stack, not inbuilt
    Before, replacing whole method made new method stack, solved by just changing body.
    Made Listener stop listening changes when I("plugin code") updates the method, solved by using the flag.
    Before, without any changes if we press undo, clash with flag and resulted in lost of the first change.
    Before, storing whole method body per change, now used relative offset and storing only changes
    Only showing action if it is method and change is available
    Undo when redo, redo when undo, any doc change -> clear redo stack, dont do changes when undo, flag updation
